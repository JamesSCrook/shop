    v1.0.1
    Changed all \n end of lines to PHP_EOL and oved the version info from
    index.php to Menu.php (so displays on every page).

    v1.0.0
    Added 2 new fields to item table: buycount & lastbuytime.
    Last buy details are recorded each time the quantity is set closer to 0.
    Admin page has Misc section for: user prof, manage items & (new) buy time.
    change_item item not found (browswer back after a del) goes to prev. page.
    New class ItemList (displayItemsByCategory moved here from Item).

    Also, deleted the docs directory tree (github pages). A while back, some
    folks posted that the kool kids preferred the main web site for a github
    repo should also be on github (e.g., pages). So I did that. Now that M$
    has bought github, I suspect I'll be moving my code anyway. So it's all
    irrelevant now in any case. It was extra effort maintaining 2 _nearly_
    identical websites, so I've removed the github pages one.
