# shop

See
[https://yosj.com.au/staff/websites/shop](https://yosj.com.au/staff/websites/shop/shop.php)
for details.

But, very briefly, shop is a LAMP website that implements a shared shopping list for N users.

There are, of course, many mofo apps that do this. But by implementing an application on your own
web/db server, only you have access to your data.

Full disclosure: I wrote this to learn OOP PHP for a Cassandra website I'm working on now.

shop is not a particularly complicated project. If you're interested in these technologies,
I recommend developing it yourself. I made the source code available in case there are people who
need it, but don't have the inclination and/or time to develop it themselves.

Technologies:
 1. Linux
 2. Apache
 3. MySQL
 4. PHP 7
 5. OOP
 6. HTML5 (including the new "grid layout" - which IE cannot handle!)

I'd also be interested in any constructive feedback about any egregious security issues. (Bearing in mind, there's no sensitive data.)

I'm a "form follows function" guy, and I have no idea how to make a website look pretty. So if anyone is interested in beautification, welcome!
