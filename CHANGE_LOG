    Also, deleted the docs directory tree (github pages). A while back, some
    folks posted that the kool kids preferred the main web site for a github
    repo should also be on github (e.g., pages). So I did that. Now that M$
    has bought github, I suspect I'll be moving my code anyway. So it's all
    irrelevant now in any case. It was extra effort maintaining 2 _nearly_
    identical websites, so I've removed the github pages one.
