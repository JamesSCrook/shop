	Version: 1.0.0
	Added 2 new fields to item table: buycount & lastbuytime.
	Last buy details are recorded each time the quantity is set closer to 0.
	Admin page has Misc section for: user prof, manage items & (new) buy time.
	change_item item not found (browswer back after a del) goes to prev. page.
	New class ItemList (displayItemsByCategory moved here from Item).

	Also, deleted the docs directory tree (github pages). A while back, some
	folks posted that the kool kids preferred the main web site for a github
	repo should also be on github (e.g., pages). So I did that. Now that M$
	has bought github, I suspect I'll be moving my code anyway. So it's all
	irrelevant now in any case. It was extra effort maintaining 2 _nearly_
	identical websites, so I've removed the github pages one.
