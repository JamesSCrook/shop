For  now,  DB  errors  are  displayed to the browser (not logged). It seems that
logging errors is normally condidered best practice. However,  not  logging  the
errors  is  based  on the assuption that some/many installations may not have an
administrator to monitor logs. This will be reviewed if required.

Session variable $_SESSION['previous_page'] is set with $_SERVER[REQUEST_URI] so
it can be used to return to the previous page  because  $_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER']
is reported to be unreliable in many cases.
